Quickstart Guide
================

This guide is the perfect place to begin exploring GILP. First, we walk through
the installation of GILP. Next, we provide a breif introduction of linear
programming and the simplex algorithm. Through one of the included
examples, we will learn how to create an LP instance, solve it using simplex,
and then visualize the result. Lastly, we will explore different solver parameters
that can be set when running simplex.
